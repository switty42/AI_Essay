Starting........
Prompt:
For this assignment, you will utilize what we have learned in the Literacy Narrative unit, but you will push this process 
further by integrating outside research into your discussion. You will once again write about a personal experience 
or personal knowledge; however, you will now build on your personal knowledge and experience with information from outside 
sources. Getting Started: Select a topic with which you are particularly knowledgeable. For example, you may examine 
a wide range of issues from reading and writing to gaming and body art. When choosing your topic, ask yourself the following: 
What have I experienced that most others have not? What is something I know a lot about? Once you have chosen a topic, 
create a list of questions that you have about the topic. Let these questions inform your research. In other words, 
we are looking for something more than your basic recycled research paper here. Your own knowledge and experience will 
be the primary source for your information and will comprise the bulk of your paper. However, you will need to supplement 
your personal knowledge with 2-3 outside sources, with at least one source from an academic database.
Chapter 12 in 
Field Guide provides specific information about reporting information, Chapter 27 provides strategies for writing as 
inquiry, and Chapter 47 provides strategies for finding sources. Beyond the Blank Page in Field Guide in has several 
examples of literacy narratives written by Southeast students.

Requirements: Essay should be 3-5 double-spaced pages, 
a properly formatted works cited page, 12 pt. Times New Roman font, 1” margins. Adhere to MLA standards for basic formatting 
and citations.

Considerations for Composing and Revising:

The essay should open with a strong introduction and close 
with a solid conclusion.
The essay should be clearly focused as you develop your main point (thesis). Your topic should 
be clear in the first paragraph.
The essay incorporates various writing strategies including narrating, defining, explaining, 
and/or analyzing; the choice of strategies depends on the topic. The strategies should help the reader understand and 
stay engaged in the topic.
The writer should exhibit ownership of the topic by effectively balancing the personal experience 
and the secondary research.
The essay should be tightly organized and clearly written.
All sources should be appropriately 
cited within the body of the essay, and the paper should conclude with a correctly formatted works cited page.
The essay 
should be reviewed for grammatical, mechanical, and usage issues. Pay attention to word choice and writing style, particularly 
when incorporating research. Please edit carefully.

Prompt 2:
For the below essay, pull out a quote that exemplifies the paper's thesis. This should be a direct quote from the essay 
and not a paraphrase or restatement.

***** Thesis number: 1 ****************************

I don't see a thesis statement in this text. This appears to be an instructional guide or assignment overview explaining 
how to write a research-supported personal narrative essay, not an actual essay itself. 

The text provides:
- Assignment 
requirements and overview
- Topic suggestions
- Planning strategies
- Essay structure guidelines
- A checklist of requirements

To 
pull out a quote exemplifying a thesis, I would need to see the actual essay that was written following these instructions, 
not the assignment guidelines themselves.


***** Essay number: 2 ****************************

I'll help you understand this assignment and provide guidance on how to approach it.

## Assignment Breakdown

This 
is a **research-supported personal narrative** that builds on the literacy narrative format. Here's what you need to 
do:

### 1. Choose Your Topic
Select something you have **unique knowledge or experience** with. Consider:
- A hobby 
or skill you've mastered
- A cultural practice or tradition you're part of
- A personal challenge you've overcome
- 
A unique job or volunteer experience
- A specific interest area (gaming, music, art, sports, etc.)

### 2. Generate 
Research Questions
Once you've chosen your topic, create questions to guide your research. For example:
- If writing 
about gaming: "How does gaming affect cognitive development?"
- If writing about body art: "What are the cultural meanings 
of tattoos across different societies?"
- If writing about a specific reading/writing experience: "How do different 
learning styles affect literacy development?"

### 3. Structure Your Essay

an engaging opening

- Weave in research to support, explain, or provide context
- Use 
various strategies (narration, definition, analysis) as appropriate
- Maintain balance between personal narrative and 
research

**Conclusion:**
- Synthesize your personal experience with the research findings
- Reflect on what this combination 
reveals

research that:
- Provides context for your experience
- Explains phenomena you've observed
- Compares your experience 
to broader patterns
- Offers expert perspectives on your topic

**Show ownership:** Demonstrate that you're the expert 
on your experience while using research to deepen understanding.

Let's say you choose 
"Learning English as a Second Language":

**Personal Experience:** Your journey learning English, specific challenges, 
breakthrough moments

**Research Questions:**

***** Thesis number: 2 ****************************

I don't see a thesis statement explicitly stated in this text. This appears to be an assignment guide or instructional 
document explaining how to write a research-supported personal narrative, rather than an essay itself that would contain 
a thesis.

The document is providing instructions for students on how to complete an assignment, including requirements, 
structure, and strategies. It doesn't present its own argument or thesis that I could quote.

If you're looking for 
the thesis of an actual essay, you would need to provide the essay itself rather than the assignment instructions.

1. **Topic Selection**
Think about areas where you have unique experience or deep knowledge. Some examples:
- A specific 
hobby or skill (gaming, cooking, music, sports)
- A cultural practice or tradition
- A learning experience (language 
learning, overcoming a challenge)
- A workplace or volunteer experience
- A health/wellness journey

### 2. **Generate 
Questions**
Once you have your topic, create research questions like:
- How common is my experience?
- What do experts 
say about this topic?
- What are the benefits/challenges others have found?
- How has this topic evolved over time?

### 
3. **Structure Suggestion**

**Introduction (1 paragraph)**
- Hook with an engaging personal anecdote
- Introduce your 
topic
- Present your thesis (what insight will you share about this experience?)

**Body Paragraphs (3-4 paragraphs)**
- 
Blend personal narrative with research
- Use research to contextualize, support, or expand on your experience
- Don't 
let research overshadow your story

**Conclusion (1 paragraph)**
- Reflect on what you've learned
- Connect personal 
and researched insights

## Example Topic Development:

Let's say you choose "Learning Guitar as an Adult":

**Personal 
Experience**: Your journey learning guitar at age 25
**Research Questions**: 
- What are the cognitive benefits of learning 
music as an adult?
- How does adult music learning differ from childhood learning?
- What challenges do adult learners 
commonly face?

**Integration Example**:
"When I first picked up the guitar at 25, my fingers fumbled awkwardly across 
the fretboard. According to neuroscientist Dr. Sarah Johnson, adult learners actually have certain advantages over children, 
including 'enhanced analytical skills and the ability to understand complex musical theory' (Johnson 45). This research 
helped me understand why, despite my initial struggles with finger placement, I quickly grasped chord progressions..."

## 
Tips for Success:

1. **Keep it personal**: Your experience should drive the narrative
2. **Use research strategically**: 
Let it enhance, not replace, your story
3. **Cite properly**: Use MLA in-text citations and Works Cited page
4. **Maintain 
balance**: Aim for about 70% personal narrative, 30% research

I apologize, but I don't see an essay in your message. You've provided what appears to be assignment instructions or 
guidance for writing a research-enhanced personal narrative essay, but not an actual essay from which I could pull a 
quote.

To help you find a quote that exemplifies a paper's thesis, I would need you to share the actual essay you're 
referring to. Once you provide the essay text, I'll be happy to identify a direct quote that best represents its central 
thesis or main argument.


***** Essay number: 13 ****************************

I'd be happy to help you with this assignment! This is an interesting hybrid between a literacy narrative and a research 
paper. Let me break down the key components and offer some guidance:

## Understanding the Assignment

You're being 
asked to:
1. Write about a topic you have personal experience/knowledge about
2. Supplement your personal narrative 
with 2-3 outside sources (at least one from an academic database)
3. Create a 3-5 page essay that balances personal 
experience with research

## Brainstorming Topics

Consider areas where you have unique experience or deep knowledge:
- 
**Hobbies/Interests**: Gaming, specific sports, music/instruments, cooking, art forms
- **Cultural/Language Experiences**: 
Being bilingual, code-switching, cultural traditions
- **Technology**: Social media literacy, coding, specific apps/platforms
- 
**Personal Challenges**: Learning differences, overcoming obstacles, health journeys
- **Work/Volunteer Experience**: 
Unique jobs, community service, specialized skills

## Developing Your Topic

Once you've chosen a topic, create research 
questions. For example:

**Topic: Gaming and Problem-Solving Skills**
- How does gaming affect cognitive development?
- 
What research exists on gaming and critical thinking?
- How do different game genres impact learning differently?

## 
Structure Suggestion

1. **Introduction**: Hook the reader with a vivid personal anecdote, then introduce your thesis
2. 
**Body Paragraphs**: 
   - Personal narrative sections
   - Research integration (use it to support, extend, or complicate 
your experience)
   - Analysis connecting personal and research elements
3. **Conclusion**: Reflect on what you've learned 
by combining experience with research

## Tips for Success

- **Balance**: Your personal experience should be the foundation; 
research should enhance, not overshadow
- **Integration**: Weave research naturally into your narrative rather than 
having separate "research sections"
- **Citations**: Use signal phrases to introduce sources smoothly
- **Voice**: Maintain 
your personal voice even when incorporating academic sources

Would you like help brainstorming specific topics or developing 
research questions for a topic you have in mind?

## Example Opening Paragraph

Here's how you might begin a paper 
about learning to cook:

> *The smell of burning rice filled our tiny apartment kitchen as I frantically stirred the 
pot, tears streaming down my face. At twenty-one, I had just moved out on my own and realized I didn't know how to cook 
anything beyond instant ramen. This moment marked the beginning of my journey into culinary literacy—a journey that 
would teach me not just about food, but about culture, creativity, and self-sufficiency. Research shows that cooking 
skills among young adults have declined significantly over the past decades, with only 28% of millennials reporting 
confidence in the kitchen (Smith 45). My experience reflects this broader trend while also revealing how learning to 
cook can become a transformative process of self-discovery.*

## Example Opening Paragraph

Here's how you might begin a paper 
about learning to cook:

> *The smell of burning rice filled our tiny apartment kitchen as I frantically stirred the 
pot, tears streaming down my face. At twenty-one, I had just moved out on my own and realized I didn't know how to cook 
anything beyond instant ramen. This moment marked the beginning of my journey into culinary literacy—a journey that 
would teach me not just about food, but about culture, creativity, and self-sufficiency. Research shows that cooking 
skills among young adults have declined significantly over the past decades, with only 28% of millennials reporting 
confidence in the kitchen (Smith 45). My experience reflects this broader trend while also revealing how learning to 
cook can become a transformative process of self-discovery.*

*The blue glow of my laptop screen

My journey into programming began not in a classroom but in my bedroom during quarantine, armed only with YouTube tutorials 
and stubborn determination. This self-directed learning experience, while challenging, reflects a growing trend in digital 
literacy that researchers have begun to recognize as fundamentally reshaping how we acquire technical skills in the 
21st century.*

***** Thesis number: 28 ****************************

Looking through this essay, I can identify the thesis statement which appears in the introduction:

"This assignment 
asks you to write about something you know well—not just intellectually, but through lived experience—and to enhance 
that personal knowledge with outside research that helps you understand, contextualize, or expand your insights."

This 
quote exemplifies the paper's core argument that the assignment requires students to combine their personal expertise/experience 
with academic research to create a research-supported personal narrative. The thesis emphasizes the dual nature of the 
assignment: drawing on what students "know well" through "lived experience" while also incorporating "outside research" 
to deepen their understanding.

I notice that the text you've provided is not an essay but rather assignment instructions and guidance for writing an 
informed personal narrative. There is no thesis statement to quote from this document because it's explaining how to 
write an essay, not presenting an argument or thesis itself.

To complete your task, I would need to see an actual essay 
(not assignment instructions) that contains a thesis statement and supporting content. Could you please provide the 
essay you'd like me to analyze?

***** Thesis number: 45 ****************************

I've read through the essay, but I don't see a single clear thesis statement that encapsulates the paper's main argument. 
This appears to be an assignment description or instructional guide rather than a completed essay with a thesis.

The 
document explains how to write a research-supported personal narrative and provides guidance on structure, research 
requirements, and writing strategies. However, it doesn't contain an actual essay with a thesis statement to quote from.

If 
you're looking for what would exemplify a thesis for this type of assignment, the document suggests that a thesis should 
present the "main argument/point" in the introduction after hooking with a personal anecdote and introducing the topic's 
significance. But there's no actual thesis statement written in this document to quote.

Could you please share the 
actual essay you'd like me to analyze for its thesis statement?


***** Essay number: 46 ****************************

I'll help you understand this assignment and provide guidance on how to approach it.

***** Thesis number: 49 ****************************

I don't see an essay in your message - it appears you've provided assignment instructions or guidance for writing a 
research-supported personal narrative essay. 

To help you find a quote that exemplifies a thesis, I would need you 
to share the actual essay you're referring to. Could you please provide the essay text so I can identify and pull out 
a relevant quote that represents its main thesis?


***** Essay number: 50 ****************************

I'll help you understand this assignment and guide you through the process. This is an interesting hybrid assignment 
that combines personal narrative with research writing.

## Understanding the Assignment

You're being asked to write 
a **research-supported literacy narrative** that:
1. Draws primarily from your personal experience/knowledge
2. Incorporates 
2-3 outside sources (at least one from an academic database)
3. Balances personal narrative with research

## Step-by-Step 
Approach

### 1. Topic Selection
Consider topics where you have unique experience or deep knowledge:
- **Traditional 
literacy topics**: Your journey learning to read/write in multiple languages, overcoming dyslexia, discovering poetry, 
etc.
- **Expanded literacy topics**: Gaming literacy, social media literacy, coding, music notation, visual arts, sports 
strategy, etc.

**Key questions to ask yourself:**
- What experiences have shaped how I communicate or understand the 
world?
- What specialized knowledge do I have that others might not?
- What literacy-related challenges have I overcome?

### 
2. Generate Research Questions
Once you have a topic, create questions that research could help answer:
- How common 
is my experience?
- What do experts say about this phenomenon?
- What theories explain what I experienced?
- How has 
this type of literacy evolved over time?

### 3. Structure Suggestions

**Introduction**
- Hook with a vivid scene or 
compelling question
- Introduce your topic clearly
- Present your thesis (what insight will you share about your literacy 
experience?)

**Body Paragraphs**
- Blend narrative sections with research support
- Use personal anecdotes as primary 
evidence
- Incorporate research to provide context, validation, or contrast
- Maintain your voice while integrating 
sources smoothly

**Conclusion**
- Reflect on what your experience means in the larger context
- Consider implications 
for others
- End with a powerful image or thought

### 4. Research Integration Tips
- Use research to **enhance** not 
replace your story
- Think of sources as conversation partners, not authorities
- Possible uses for research:
  - Statistics 
that contextualize your experience
  - Expert opinions that validate or challenge your perspective
  - Historical background 
that enriches your narrative

### 5. Example Topic Development

**Topic**: Learning to code as a form of literacy

**Personal 
Experience**: Your journey from struggling with traditional writing to finding expression through programming

**Research 
Questions**:
- How do educators define "digital literacy"?
- What cognitive skills overlap between coding and traditional 
writing?
- How common is it for people with writing difficulties to excel at coding?

**Research Integration**: You 
might cite studies on multiple literacies, include statistics on coding education, or reference experts who discuss 
programming as a language.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Don't let research overwhelm your personal story
- Avoid generic 
topics unless you have a unique angle
- Don't force connections between research and experience
- Remember this isn't 
a traditional research paper

## MLA Reminders
- In-text citations: (Author's Last Name Page#)
- Works Cited: alphabetical 
order, hanging indent
- Academic database sources need database name included

***** Thesis number: 58 ****************************

I don't see an essay in your message - you've provided an assignment description and guidance for writing a research-enhanced 
personal narrative, but not an actual essay to analyze.

To help you find a quote that exemplifies a paper's thesis,

*The first time I held a welding torch, my hands shook so badly that my instructor had to steady my arm. 
As a woman entering the male-dominated field of welding, I faced not only the physical challenges of the craft but also 
the psychological barriers of breaking gender stereotypes. According to the American Welding Society, women make up 
only 5.3% of welders in the United States (Smith 42). My journey from nervous beginner to certified welder illustrates 
both the personal determination required and the systemic changes needed to diversify trade professions.*

***** Thesis number: 71 ****************************

I've read through the text you provided, but this appears to be assignment instructions or guidance for writing a research-informed 
literacy narrative, not an actual essay with a thesis. 

To pull out a quote that exemplifies a paper's thesis, I would 
need to see the actual essay that was written in response to these instructions. The text you've shared is explaining 
how to write such an essay, including topics to consider, structure, research strategies, and organization patterns.

Could 
you please share the actual essay you'd like me to analyze? Once you provide the essay itself, I'll be able to identify 
and quote the thesis statement directly.


***** Essay number: 72 ****************************

I'd be happy to help you with this research-based literacy narrative assignment. Let me break down what you need to 
do and provide some guidance:

## Understanding the Assignment

This is a **research-enhanced personal narrative** where 
you'll:
1. Write about something you have personal experience/expertise in
2. Support your personal knowledge with 2-3 
outside sources (at least one from an academic database)
3. Create a 3-5 page essay that balances personal narrative 
with research

## Steps to Get Started:

### 1. **Topic Selection**
Think about:
- Special skills or hobbies you have
- 
Unique experiences you've had
- Areas where you have insider knowledge
- Topics you're passionate about

Examples:
- 
Your experience learning a second language
- Your journey as a gamer and gaming culture
- Your experience with a specific 
sport or art form
- Your relationship with social media
- A job or volunteer experience that taught you something significant

### 
2. **Generate Research Questions**
Once you have a topic, ask yourself:
- What aspects of my experience connect to larger 
trends or issues?
- What do experts say about this topic?
- How does my experience compare to others'?
- What historical 
or cultural context surrounds my experience?

### 3. **Structure Suggestions**

**Introduction:**
- Hook with a vivid 
personal anecdote
- Introduce your topic clearly
- Present your thesis (what insight will you share about this topic?)

**Body 
Paragraphs:**
- Alternate between personal narrative and research
- Use research to:
  - Provide context for your experience
 
- Support your observations
  - Show how your experience fits into larger patterns
  - Challenge or complicate your 
initial understanding

**Conclusion:**
- Reflect on how research enhanced your understanding
- Consider implications 
beyond your personal experience

### 4. **Balancing Personal and Research**
- Lead with your experience
- Use research 
to deepen, not replace, your narrative
- Integrate quotes smoothly
- Always return to how research relates to YOUR story

### 
5. **Example Integration**
Instead of: "According to Smith, 50% of teenagers experience anxiety."
Try: "When I started 
feeling anxious before every test, I thought I was alone. However, researcher Jane Smith's finding that 50% of teenagers 
experience test anxiety helped me understand my experience as part of a larger pattern."

## MLA Reminders:
- In-text 
citations: (Author's Last Name Page#)
- Works Cited page: separate page, alphabetical order

>>>>> This is the thesis  prompt with essay attached >>>>>>>

For the below essay, pull out a quote that exemplifies the paper's thesis. This should be a direct quote from the essay 
and not a paraphrase or restatement.

I'd be happy to help you with this research-based literacy narrative assignment. 
Let me break down what you need to do and provide some guidance:

## Understanding the Assignment

This is a **research-enhanced 
personal narrative** where you'll:
1. Write about something you have personal experience/expertise in
2. Support your 
personal knowledge with 2-3 outside sources (at least one from an academic database)
3. Create a 3-5 page essay that 
balances personal narrative with research

## Steps to Get Started:

### 1. **Topic Selection**
Think about:
- Special 
skills or hobbies you have
- Unique experiences you've had
- Areas where you have insider knowledge
- Topics you're 
passionate about

Examples:
- Your experience learning a second language
- Your journey as a gamer and gaming culture
- 
Your experience with a specific sport or art form
- Your relationship with social media
- A job or volunteer experience 
that taught you something significant

### 2. **Generate Research Questions**
Once you have a topic, ask yourself:
- 
What aspects of my experience connect to larger trends or issues?
- What do experts say about this topic?
- How does 
my experience compare to others'?
- What historical or cultural context surrounds my experience?

### 3. **Structure 
Suggestions**

**Introduction:**
- Hook with a vivid personal anecdote
- Introduce your topic clearly
- Present your 
thesis (what insight will you share about this topic?)

**Body Paragraphs:**
- Alternate between personal narrative 
and research
- Use research to:
  - Provide context for your experience
  - Support your observations
  - Show how your 
experience fits into larger patterns
  - Challenge or complicate your initial understanding

**Conclusion:**
- Reflect 
on how research enhanced your understanding
- Consider implications beyond your personal experience

### 4. **Balancing 
Personal and Research**
- Lead with your experience
- Use research to deepen, not replace, your narrative
- Integrate 
quotes smoothly
- Always return to how research relates to YOUR story

### 5. **Example Integration**
Instead of: "According 
to Smith, 50% of teenagers experience anxiety."
Try: "When I started feeling anxious before every test, I thought I 
was alone. However, researcher Jane Smith's finding that 50% of teenagers experience test anxiety helped me understand 
my experience as part of a larger pattern."

## MLA Reminders:
- In-text citations: (Author's Last Name Page#)
- Works 
Cited page: separate page, alphabetical order
- Academic database sources often have citation tools built in

I experienced?

### 4. **Research 
Integration Tips**

  - Provide background/context
  - Validate your experience
  - Show contrasts 
or similarities to others' experiences

### 5. **Example of Integration**
Personal: 
"When I first started gaming at age 10, I noticed I could remember complex map layouts after seeing them just once."

Research 
integration: "This enhanced spatial memory aligns with research by Green and Bavelier (2019), who found that action 
video game players demonstrate superior spatial cognition skills compared to non-players."

## Key Reminders:

sources required** (at least one from academic database)
- **MLA format** for citations and Works Cited
- **3-5 pages** 
double-spaced
- Focus on **your experience first**, research second

renaissance. According to a 2023 Pew Research study, 32% of Americans now have at least one tattoo, a dramatic increase 
from just 21% a decade ago (Smith 45). This shift reflects not just changing fashion trends, but a fundamental transformation 
in how we view body art, self-expression, and professional identity."

***** Thesis number: 100 ****************************

I apologize, but I don't see an essay in your message. You've provided what appears to be assignment instructions or 
guidance for writing a research-supported personal narrative essay, but not an actual completed essay from which I could 
pull a quote.

To help you find a quote that exemplifies a paper's thesis, I would need to see the actual essay text.

----------- Final report -------------- 
AI Prompt:
For this assignment, you will utilize what we have learned in the Literacy Narrative unit, but you will push this process 
further by integrating outside research into your discussion. You will once again write about a personal experience 
or personal knowledge; however, you will now build on your personal knowledge and experience with information from outside 
sources. Getting Started: Select a topic with which you are particularly knowledgeable. For example, you may examine 
a wide range of issues from reading and writing to gaming and body art. When choosing your topic, ask yourself the following: 
What have I experienced that most others have not? What is something I know a lot about? Once you have chosen a topic, 
create a list of questions that you have about the topic. Let these questions inform your research. In other words, 
we are looking for something more than your basic recycled research paper here. Your own knowledge and experience will 
be the primary source for your information and will comprise the bulk of your paper. However, you will need to supplement 
your personal knowledge with 2-3 outside sources, with at least one source from an academic database.
Chapter 12 in 
Field Guide provides specific information about reporting information, Chapter 27 provides strategies for writing as 
inquiry, and Chapter 47 provides strategies for finding sources. Beyond the Blank Page in Field Guide in has several 
examples of literacy narratives written by Southeast students.

Requirements: Essay should be 3-5 double-spaced pages, 
a properly formatted works cited page, 12 pt. Times New Roman font, 1” margins. Adhere to MLA standards for basic formatting 
and citations.

Considerations for Composing and Revising:

The essay should open with a strong introduction and close 
with a solid conclusion.
The essay should be clearly focused as you develop your main point (thesis). Your topic should 
be clear in the first paragraph.
The essay incorporates various writing strategies including narrating, defining, explaining, 
and/or analyzing; the choice of strategies depends on the topic. The strategies should help the reader understand and 
stay engaged in the topic.
The writer should exhibit ownership of the topic by effectively balancing the personal experience 
and the secondary research.
The essay should be tightly organized and clearly written.
All sources should be appropriately 
cited within the body of the essay, and the paper should conclude with a correctly formatted works cited page.
The essay 
should be reviewed for grammatical, mechanical, and usage issues. Pay attention to word choice and writing style, particularly 
when incorporating research. Please edit carefully.

AI Prompt2:
For the below essay, pull out a quote that exemplifies the paper's thesis. This should be a direct quote from the essay 
and not a paraphrase or restatement.
