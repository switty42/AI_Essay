For around 3-5 pages, write a full draft essay about a personal experience or personal knowledge, but build on your personal knowledge and experience with information from outside sources. Please select a topic with which you are particularly knowledgeable. For example, you may examine a wide range of topics from reading and writing to gaming and body art. When choosing your topic, ask yourself the following: What have I experienced that most others have not? What is something I know a lot about? Once you have chosen a topic, create a list of questions that you have about the topic. Let these questions inform your research. This should be more than a basic recycled research paper. Your own knowledge and experience will be the primary source for your information and will comprise the bulk of your paper. Supplement your personal knowledge with 2-3 outside sources, with at least one source from an academic database.



The essay should open with a strong introduction and close with a solid conclusion.


The essay should be clearly focused as you develop your main point (thesis). Your topic should be clear in the first paragraph.


The essay incorporates various writing strategies including narrating, defining, explaining, and/or analyzing; the choice of strategies depends on the topic. The strategies should help the reader understand and stay engaged in the topic.


The writer should exhibit ownership of the topic by effectively balancing the personal experience and the secondary research.


The essay should be tightly organized and clearly written.


All sources should be appropriately cited within the body of the essay, and the paper should conclude with a correctly formatted works cited page.


The essay should be reviewed for grammatical, mechanical, and usage issues. Pay attention to word choice and writing style, particularly when incorporating research. Please edit carefully.
