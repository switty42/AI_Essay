For an audience constituted of members of your English 100 class (i.e. your peers), compose a “Literacy Narrative” in which you reflect on memories of a past experience related to your literate practices. Literacy in this context is defined in broad terms as knowledge of or competence in a subject or area of activity. Literate practices may include speaking, writing, reading, interpretation, and performance. These practices may manifest via the acquisition of communication conventions, the expectations for behavior or performance, an understanding and acceptance of roles and/or responsibilities, etc. 

Because this essay emphasizes remembering, you should focus your essay on a specific scene or important event that illustrates 1) a defining moment that exemplifies your literate practices and 2) the status of your literate practices as they changed or failed to change as a result of this event. In addition, “A remembering essay is not a random narrative...[it] should have a clear main point, focus on a main idea, or make a discovery.” Your essay should clearly answer the question “So what?” or “What’s the point?” At the same time, you should avoid the trite thesis that announces “the moral of the story” in your conclusion. You do not have to make deeply personal revelations about yourself in order to write an interesting reflection on your literate practices. 

Chapter 10 in Field Guide provides key features of writing literacy narratives. Chapter 21 has key features of reflections, and Chapter 59 has examples of literacy narratives by professional writers. Beyond the Blank Page has several examples of literacy narratives written by Southeast students. 

Requirements: Essay should be 3-5 double-spaced pages, 12 pt. Times New Roman font, 1” margins 

Considerations for Revision: A. Does the narrative explore a specific event that exemplifies your literate practices? B. Does the narrative have a clear main point, which addresses the importance of this event either for you personally or for people generally? C. Does the narrative have a title and an introductory paragraph that promote interest? D. Does the narrative support claims about your literacy through vivid description and careful explanation of the focal event, the setting in which it occurred, and the characters involved, showing these details rather than telling? E. Does the narrative have effective transitions between sentences, paragraphs, and larger sections? F. Is the narrative free of mechanical, grammatical, and usage errors? Pay particular attention to the following:
