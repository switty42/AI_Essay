For this assignment, you will utilize what we have learned in the Literacy Narrative unit, but you will push this process further by integrating outside research into your discussion. You will once again write about a personal experience or personal knowledge; however, you will now build on your personal knowledge and experience with information from outside sources. Getting Started: Select a topic with which you are particularly knowledgeable. For example, you may examine a wide range of issues from reading and writing to gaming and body art. When choosing your topic, ask yourself the following: What have I experienced that most others have not? What is something I know a lot about? Once you have chosen a topic, create a list of questions that you have about the topic. Let these questions inform your research. In other words, we are looking for something more than your basic recycled research paper here. Your own knowledge and experience will be the primary source for your information and will comprise the bulk of your paper. However, you will need to supplement your personal knowledge with 2-3 outside sources, with at least one source from an academic database.
Chapter 12 in Field Guide provides specific information about reporting information, Chapter 27 provides strategies for writing as inquiry, and Chapter 47 provides strategies for finding sources. Beyond the Blank Page in Field Guide in has several examples of literacy narratives written by Southeast students.
